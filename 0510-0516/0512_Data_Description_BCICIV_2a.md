1. number of subject: 9

2. number of motor imagery tasks: 4

class 1: movement of left hand, 

class 2: movement of right hand, 

class 3: movement of both feet, 

class 4: tongue 

3. number of sessions: 2, on different days, for each subject

4. number of runs per session: 6

5. number of trials per run: 48 (12 for each of the four classes) 

(48 * 6 = 288 trials per session for each subject) 

---

Experiment scheme: 

1. At the beginning of each session, a recording of approximately 5 mins was performed to estimate the EOG influence. (eyes open, eyes closed, eyes movement) 

The EOG channels are provided for the subsequent application of artifact processing methods and must not be used for classification. 

All data sets are stored in the General Data Format for biomedical signals, **one file per subject and session** (that's why 2 * 9 = 18 files). 

Only one session contains the class labels for all trials, whereas the other session will be used to test the classifier and hence to evaluate the performance. **AXXT** means for training **AXXE** means for testing.
