Q1. How to set the number of trials and the number of subjects of one session?

1. number of trials: >= 30, if larger than 40 is better. 

2. number of subjects: >= 8 subjects (for paper). 10 is good.

Q2. The simplest way to get results: 

Find the open source datasets (>=2) and implement CSP. 

Point: It is important to explain the originality of algorithm and data processing. 

Q3. What kinds of work can be further researched? 

1. Improve the spatial resolution of EEG signals. 

  e.g., Combine fMRI data with EEG signals (VBEMG, estimate the spatial location by fMRI data and then infer with EEG signals)
  
2. Estimation of continuous signals. 

3. Inter-subject electrodes location projection. 

4. SLR(Sparse Logistic Regression)

5. CSP

6. Sliding window with CSP(Hilbert transform?) 

7. Design experiments to collect data (points will be the originality of the experiment design)
