## Contributions: 5 schemes for adaption of a deep CNN with limited EEG data. 84.19% (9.98%)

## Baseline: Schirrmeister(2017) 

### Goal: Leverage the features extracted from the convolution filters in the model and adapt the classifier to a subject it has never encountered. 

### Classification accuracy for motor imagery of SOTA approaches: 60% - 80%
