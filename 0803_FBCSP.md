## Filter bank common spatial pattern algorithm on BCI competition IV Datasets 2a and 2b 

**Common spatial pattern (CSP)** algorithm is an effective and popular method for classifying **2-class motor imagery EEG data**, 

but its effectiveness depends on the subject-specific frequency band. 

Multi-class extensions to FBCSP are presented to handle the 4-class EEG data in Dataset 2a. 

Two feature selection algorithms are presented to select discriminative CSP features on Dataset 2b:
**Mutual information **
