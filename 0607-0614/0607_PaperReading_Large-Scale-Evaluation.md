## A large-scale evaluation framework for EEG deep learning architectures

1. A collection of EEG datasets currently including 100 examples (recording sessions) from six different classification problems. 

2. A collection of different EEG decoding algorithms 

3. A wrapper linking the decoders to the data as well as handling structured documentation of all settings and hyper-parameters and statistics. 

Three publicly available CNN architectures:

1. Braindecode Deep4 ConvNet

2. Braindecode Shallow ConvNet

3. Two versions of EEGNet

**A systematic evaluation of deep learning for EEG which addresses these challenges**

EEG Datasets: motor tasks, speech imagery, error processing.
