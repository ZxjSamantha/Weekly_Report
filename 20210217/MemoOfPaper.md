# Subject-Independent Brain-Computer Intefaces Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

It is an interesting topic to build a calibration-free or subject-independent BCI. 

The database is composed of 54 subjects performing the left- and right-hand MI on two different days, resulting in 21600 trials for the MI tasks. 
(?why the type of tasks are so limited?)
