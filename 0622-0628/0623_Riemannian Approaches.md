## Riemannian Approaches in Brain-Computer Interfaces: A Review 

BCIs should be robust across contexts, time and users, and with calibration times as short as possible. These challenges can be addressed at multiple levels:

1. neuroscience level: by identifying new neurophysiological markers that are more reliable than the ones currently used. 

2. human level: by training users to gain accurate and stable control over the EEG patterns they produce. 

3. signal processing level: by building features and classifiers that are robust to context changes

Riemannian approaches enable the direct manipulation of EEG signal covariance matrices and subspaces with the Riemannian geometry.
