## EEGNet: A Compact Convolutional Neural Network for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces

For oscillary-based classficiation of SMR, the traditional approach is the One-Versus-Rest (OVR) filter-bank common spatial pattern. 

---

Classification results are reported for two sets of analysis: within-subject and cross-subject. 

- within-subject classification: a portion of the subjects data to train a model specifically for that subject

- cross-subject classification: use the data from other subjects to train a subject-agnostic model.
